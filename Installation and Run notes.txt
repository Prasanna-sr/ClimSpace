Run notes
---------
pre-requisite - Make sure JAVA_HOME is pointed appropriately in batch files

1. run 'ant build' from installed folder. This compiles the sources to the 'classes' directory.

2. run 'ant war' 
            - creates a P1.war file
            - deploys the P1.war to running Jboss

3. run 'ant nws' 
            - starts the initial sequence to 
                - connect to "http://mesowest.utah.edu/data/mesowest.out.gz" and initiate metadata  read on startup(once)
                - connect to "http://mesowest.utah.edu/data/mesowest.csv.gz" and initiate data read on every 10 minutes

4. run 'ant analyst'
            - runs sample to do a analyst query and stores read data to file located in .\data\outFiles

5.run 'ant mesonet' -
                 - updates mesonat data to the system.

6. run 'ant point' - gives the output for public user
